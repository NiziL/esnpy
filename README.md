# esnpy

`esnpy` is an out-of-the-box framework to experiment around ESN and DeepESN.  
Models has been implemented using pure NumPy/SciPy, so there's no need for a powerful GPU, or some esoteric installations.  

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Pypi

Coming soon

#### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NiZiL/esnpy
pip install .
```
